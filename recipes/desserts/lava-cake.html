            <p>
                Legend has it that the first chocolate lava cake was the result
                of a major catering disaster. The dessert for this particular
                event was to be individual chocolate cakes, but someone took
                them out of the oven too soon, and the centers were not cooked
                enough and still liquefied. There was no time to take them off
                the plates and bake them more, so the chef simply had his wait
                staff introduce the dessert as chocolate "lava" cakes —
                brilliant!

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust</li>
                <li>5 cups apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons cold butter</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)</li>
                <li>
                    Arrange apple slices in unbaked pie shell. Mix 1/2 cup sugar
                    and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the crumble topping: Place 1/3 cup sugar and flour
                    in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or pastry
                    blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; spoon
                    mixture over apples.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven until apples are soft and top is
                    lightly browned, about 40 minutes.
