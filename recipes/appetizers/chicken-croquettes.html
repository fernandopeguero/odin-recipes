                I made these chicken croquettes as a surprise for my mom on
                Mother's Day. She used to get chicken croquettes at a fancy
                restaurant when she was a young woman. She loved them!

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    Combine chicken, 1/3 cup of condensed soup, bread crumbs,
                    celery, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning in large
                    bowl; mix well and shape into 6 croquettes (or patties).
                    Chill in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll croquettes in additional bread crumbs. Melt butter in a
                    large skillet over medium heat; add croquettes and cook
                    until golden and browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, combine remaining condensed soup, milk, and 1/8
                    tablespoon poultry seasoning in a small saucepan over low
                    heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through.
                    Serve sauce over croquettes.
