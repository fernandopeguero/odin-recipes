            <p>
                I can't guarantee you'll be able to find Burrata and fresh Black
                Mission figs, but if you can, you really must give this a try.
                I'll tell you right now that there really isn't a substitute for
                this heavenly cheese.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>12 Black Mission figs, halved lengthwise</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>6 ounces Burrata cheese, thickly sliced</li>
                <li>6 (1/2 inch thick) slices Italian bread, toasted</li>
                <li>sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the
                    grate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place figs, skin-side down, on grill. Cook until figs start
                    to swell and bubble, 2 to 4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk together balsamic vinegar and olive oil until
                    completely combined, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place Burrata cheese on top of each piece of toast. Spread
                    figs around bread and drizzle with balsamic vinegar mixture.
                    Season with sea salt and black pepper to taste.
                </li>
            </ol>
