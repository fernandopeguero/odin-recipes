            <p class="description">
                This deceptively simple buttermilk biscuit recipe can come out a
                million different ways with some very minor variations on the
                ingredients and amounts. This one's my favorite — flaky, but not
                dry; chewy, but not tough; and crisp in just the right spots.
                Ice-cold butter and some extra dough folding are key to having
                lots of flaky layers in each golden brown buttermilk biscuit.

            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>
                    7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled in freezer and cut
                    into thin slices
                </li>
                <li>¾ cup cold buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons buttermilk for brushing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking
                    sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
                    in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut into the
                    flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles
                    coarse crumbs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold
                    buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just
                    combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together
                    into a rectangle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather
                    any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice
                    more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use
                    a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll
                    any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an
                    indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush
                    buttermilk over the tops.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and
                    golden brown, about 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
