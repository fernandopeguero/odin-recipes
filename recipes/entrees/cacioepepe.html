                This spaghetti cacio e pepe recipe has been made in our family
                for many years, and everyone loves it. It is a very basic and
                easy variation on mac and cheese.

                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
                    spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until
                    tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup
                    cooking water, then drain spaghetti.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and
                    stir garlic and pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2
                    minutes. Add cooked spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese.
                    Ladle in 1/2 cup reserved cooking water; stir until cheese
                    is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in more cooking water as
                    needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce coats spaghetti,
                    about 1 minute more.
